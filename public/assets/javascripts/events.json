      • <b>does the company have a sustainable competitive advantage?</b> </p> <p>Developing a sustainable competitive advantage, by creating an IP portfolio from the very early stages of a startup, is a critical element.

      <b><a href="http://www.procopio.com/attorneys/noel-c-gillespie">Noel Gillespie, a partner at Procopio</a>,</b> will discuss:</p> <p>

      • the different forms of Intellectual Property (patents, copyrights trade secrets etc.);</p> <p>

      • which type of IP is best suited to startups with software and other products; and   </p> <p>• how they should work together in an IP portfolio/plan. </p> <p>• how you should present the IP portfolio/plan in your pitch deck, with an emphasis on how to convey that your IP portfolio/plan will create value by creating a sustainable competitive advantage; and then</p> <p>• how to actually implement the plan in a cost effective manner, with particular emphasis on how you can cost effectively build a portfolio early on when funds are scarce, but not compromise the ultimate protection/advantage that the portfolio is intended to provide.</p> <p>

      Because our Meetup is primarily all about education and access, we will leave at least 45 minutes for an interactive discussion with participants, so bring all your questions!</p> <p>

      Gayle McDowell is the author of the book "Cracking the PM Interview", the #1 interview prep book for aspiring product managers. During this talk, she will teach you how to prepare for PM interviews, what top companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft really look for, and how to tackle the toughest problems. This is not a fluffy be-your-best talk; it is deeply tactical and will discuss how the ambiguously-named "PM" (product manager / program manager) role varies across companies, what experience you need, how to make your existing experience translate, what a great PM resume and cover letter look like, and finally, how to master the PM interview questions (estimation questions, behavioral questions, case questions, product questions, technical questions, and the super important "pitch").</p> <p>

      "description": "<p>HTML and CSS are the languages of the web, used by the billions of webpages out there today to mark up and style their content. They're also used in email marketing campaigns, blog posts, and more. If you're in the tech space or thinking of being a frontend developer, you should get HTML/CSS in your toolkit.</p> <p><br/>Want to learn how to make webpages? Already have your own blog, but want to have more control over ? This 2-day workshop is for you!</p> <p>This two-day workshop will be largely<i>"self-paced"</i>. That means that we'll start with a round of introductions and an overview of the web, and then you'll watch videos and do challenges <i>at your own pace</i>, using <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Khan Academy</a>. We will stop to work on pair projects twice a day, and we'll have TAs to answer questions and help when you get stuck.</p> <p><br/>We will go from <b>11:45am</b> to <b>6:15pm</b> on both Saturday and Sunday, and each day will start with catered lunch.</p> <p>Bring a laptop, charger, and headphones with you. If you don't have any of those, please let us know.</p> <p><br/>If you're interested in helping out as a TA, please let us know. If you recently took the HTML/CSS class, TAing can be a great test of your skills! It can also be a great way to meet other people in our community.</p> <p><b>Many thanks to our sponsor <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> for the wonderful space and snacks.</b></p> <p><i><br/></i></p> <p><i>(This workshop is half the normal rate due to there being no instructor, and proceeds from this workshop will go back to our chapter fund.

      -- Instructors -- </p> <p>ALBREY </p> <p>Albrey is a software engineer, and currently a mentor at Hack Reactor. His love for teaching started at a young age, and over the years he's developed a knack for breaking down complex topics into simple, digestible knowledge. When not focused on JavaScript most of Albrey's time is spent between playing basketball and searching the city for the best burritos. If you know a spot, feel free to reach out. </p> <p>


      JEFF</p> <p>Jeff is a software engineer at Mindjet who embraces the notion that "everyone's got to start somewhere." When he's not writing full-stack JavaScript at work, he enjoys helping others learn it. He guides students along the learning curve of coding by teaching JS classes and blogging about software engineering. Check out his articles at <a href="http://rebootjeff.github.io" class="linkified">http://rebootjeff.github.io</a></p> <p>--- FAQ ---</p> <p>Am I at the right level for this class?<br/>This class is for budding developers with at least 3 months of JavaScript experience. It's recommended that potential students have already completed at least one or two online JavaScript tutorials from the likes of Codecademy or CodeSchool. People with more experience also tend to get a lot out of this course. More specifically, students should already be very comfortable with the basics of arrays, objects, looping, calling functions, and the "return" keyword. </p> <p>Do I need to bring a laptop?<br/>Yes.</p> <p>


      Will food be provided? </p> <p>Lunch, coffee and snacks will be provided.</p> <p>


      Will this help me get into Hack Reactor or MakerSquare? </p> <p>This class and the material covered will help you get into and succeed at any coding bootcamp; however there is no guarantee that your prospects will improve. Taking this class has no impact on your admissions process. I can't make it this time. </p> <p>


      When will the next one be? </p> <p>TBD. </p> <p>


      Are there any options for remote attendance? </p> <p>No. Unfortunately, you cannot attend remotely.</p>",
